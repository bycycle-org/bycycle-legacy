byCycle Trip Planner - Installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Created 2006-01-23


Dependencies
============

There are few pieces of additional software necessary to run the byCycle
system. All of these are free and available for just about any platform.

Core Dependencies
-----------------

Dependencies must be installed in roughly the order given. The provided
installation commands are somewhat Ubuntu-specific but should work on
other platforms with a little modification (on Windows there are usually
installers for the things that are installed from source on Linux).

- Python 2.5.x <http://www.python.org/>

- setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>
  wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
  python ez_setup.py

- PostgreSQL 8.1.x <http://www.postgresql.org/>
  [FIXME: I'm not sure the dev stuff is actually needed.]
  apt-get install postgresql-8.1 postgresql-dev postgresql-server-dev-8.1

- psycopg2 DBAPI module <http://initd.org/tracker/psycopg/wiki/PsycopgTwo>
  easy_install -UZ psycopg2

- SQLAlchemy (latest) <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>
  easy_install -UZ SQLAlchemy

- GEOS 2.2.3 <http://geos.refractions.net/geos-2.2.3.tar.bz2>
  [I can't remember why, but the Ubuntu package won't work.]
  tar xvbf geos-2.2.3.tar.bz2
  ./configure
  make
  make install

- Proj 4.5.0 <ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.5.0.tar.gz>
  tar xvzf proj-4.5.0.tar.gz
  ./configure
  make
  make install

- PostGIS 1.1.6 <http://postgis.refractions.net/download/postgis-1.1.6.tar.gz>
  - Needs Proj and GEOS for some operations
  tar xvzf postgis-1.1.6.tar.gz
  ./configure
  make
  make install

- Python Cartographic Library - Core 0.11.0
  - Depends on zope.interface
    <http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface/3.3.0/zope.interface-3.3.0.tar.gz>
    tar xvzf zope.interface-3.3.0.tar.gz
    cd zope.interface-3.3.0
    setup.py install
  - Also needs Proj and GEOS for some operations
  <http://gispython.org/downloads/gispy/PCL-0.11.0.tar.gz>
  tar xvzf PCL-0.11.0.tar.gz
  cd PCL/PCL-Core
  python setup.py install

Web Interface
-------------

- Pylons (latest) <http://pylonshq.com/>
  easy_install -UZ Pylons

- Google Map
  If you want to view the Google Map on a local installation, you will need a
  Google Maps API key for the domain name it runs under.
  <http://www.google.com/apis/maps/>.

Development
-----------

- Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>
  apt-get install subversion
  - On Windows, you'll almost definitely want TortoiseSVN
    <http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/>

- On Ubuntu, you'll need to install some basic dev tools:
  [FIXME: Other packages may be required as well.]
  apt-get install build-essential

Deployment
----------

- Apache 2.2.latest <http://httpd.apache.org/>
  [Note: Not required for a dev environment--use Paste server.]
  - mod_python OR mod_proxy (this is an open question)

Other combinations of the above software may work but have not been tested. In
general, we are going to keep up with the latest stable releases of all
supporting software.


Installation
============

- Check out the code:
  svn co http://svn.bycycle.org/byCycle/core/branches/enterprise/byCycle byCycle

- Move the byCycle directory to /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (substitute
  "/usr/lib/python2.4" with path to your Python installation)


Testing

Data
====

[Warning: This part needs some updating.]

Under certain circumstances, the package will be provided with the database
and routing matrix included. In this case, you shouldn't have to do anything
else.

When the data is not supplied, here's what you do to add a new data mode and
its associated travel modes to the model:

- Make sure you have shp2pgsql (part of PostGIS) installed first and that
  it is on your PATH

- Make a new directory in the model for the data and associated scripts
  'mkdir byCycle/model/timbuktu'

- Create a directory to hold your data files
  'mkdir byCycle/model/timbuktu/data'

- Put your data files for import (e.g., timbuktu.shp, timbuktu.dbf) in a
  subdirectory of the data directory. It doesn't really matter what the
  directory is called; just make it something meaningful for you and something
  that will distinguish it from any future versions of your data.

- Copy the files __init__.py and bicycle.py from byCycle/model/portlandor to
  byCycle/model/timbuktu/

- Copy the files shp2pgsql.py and tables.py from byCycle/model/portlandor/data
  to byCycle/model/timbuktu/data

- Here's where it gets hard: now you have to modify tables.py and shp2pgsql.py
  to be able to import your data. How you will do this depends on your data. If
  your data is similar to other datasets we've seen, then it will be fairly
  easy; if not, it might be hard, possibly very hard (or just tedious and
  annoying).

- If you get past the above step, you now need to modify __init__.py and
  bicycle.py. You will modify __init__.py to create the adjacency matrix for
  routing. This shouldn't be too difficult. You just need to specify which
  fields from the DB you want to use. To create the adjacency matrix, run
  __init__.py as a script. Next, you will modify bicycle.py to create the
  weight (or "cost" if you prefer) function using the fields that should now
  be in the adjacency matrix.

If everything went well, you should now be able to look up addresses and find
routes using the data you imported and the files modified as detailed above.

One thing to keep in mind when doing the above is to make sure you keep the
structure the same as the other data modes in the model. In other words, you
want the same directory structure and the same paths, except you'll
change portlandor to timbuktu and add or remove fields as appropriate to your
data.
