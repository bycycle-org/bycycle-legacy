ReadMe for byCycle Trip Planner
01/23/2006


Introduction
------------

The byCycle Trip Planner is a system for finding and planning trips made by 
bicycle. It uses different data modes and associated weighting functions to do 
trip planning for different datasets and travel modes.

The system is being designed so that any interface (within reason) should be 
able to call the back end. To that end a RESTful web service interface has 
been implemented. The result is returned in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). 
See http://www.bycycle.org/tripplanner/rest.html for more info on that.

Using the web service, creating an AJAX-enhanced Web interface (for example) 
should be fairly easy (and, in fact, this is what we have done for the latest 
version).


This Version
------------

This is version 0.3. 0.3 is a big jump from 0.2. It includes facilities for 
easily incorporating and using new sets of data.
